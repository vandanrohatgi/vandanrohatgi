### Hey

My name is Vandan and I'm an engineering undergraduate. Along with math I'm into 2 things:

1. Container Tech :whale:
2. Cyber security :lock:
3. Human psychology :brain:
4. exploring new stuff :world_map:

###### ~~(yes I wrote I'm into math just for the joke. I'm terrible at it)~~

I mostly use github to post my [blogs](https://vandanrohatgi.github.io) along with my projects or any other code that I think is interesting in the slightest.

Take a look around... Vandan out!
