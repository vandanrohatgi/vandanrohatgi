### How YOU doin? :grin:

My name is Vandan and I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology. I am passionate about 2 things:

1. Docker :whale:
2. Cyber security :lock:
3. exploring new stuff 

I mostly use github to post my [blogs](https://vandanrohatgi.github.io) along with my projects or any other code that I think is interesting in the slightest.

Take a look around! Vandan out!
